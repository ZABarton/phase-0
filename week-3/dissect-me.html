		If you've ever received an email with an attachment named something along the lines of "Draft Report - Final Version - Changes 12/5/15_DRAFT (Final)" then you might understand how useful version control can be. When multiple users are editing a single file, it becomes difficult to know who has the latest copy of the file, or who changed it last. Changes made between yesterday and two weeks ago may become impossible to compare. Version control does away with all of these problems. By retaining a master copy of the file in a safe location, other users can make copies of it and return their edited versions to this central location, providing a record of accountability for which changes belong to which user, and the order in which they were submitted.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We keep returning to the basic document skeleton tags (html, body, head, title) since those are used in every document. It's always good to keep practicing using the fundamental tags so that we remember where they go and in which order.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser will display the elements in a page from top to bottom, starting with content at the top of the body section and working its way downward. Elements will get laid out next to each other with no spacing unless there isn't room (in which case a new line of content is created) or if there are HTML tags to specify a new paragraph or line break.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I had no idea that snippets were a thing you could use. I learned that the html trigger would provide a basic HTML document skeleton, and I learned how to create a new snippet to provide an even better skeleton. I'm sure that snippets will come in handy to efficiently solve routine tasks, just like how the command line became an efficient replacement for the graphical interface. It looks like there are a lot of snippets included for php commands, which I'm sure will be useful later in my programming career.

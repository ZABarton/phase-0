# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

Creating a repository on GitHub can be accomplished on the GitHub website. Navigate your browser to http://www.github.com, sign in, and click the plus icon in the upper right corner of the screen. When the menu pops up, select "New Repository." The next screen is where you can fill in the necessary information for your repository. You can give your repository a name, set the viewing settings to public or private, and select your open source license. Once complete, click the "Create Repository" button at the bottom of the screen.

Once inside your repository (the page should list [YOUR USERNAME]/[YOUR REPOSITORY NAME]), you can find a URL in the header above the list of files. Copy that URL to the clipboard and then switch to your terminal. Once you have navigated to the desired location (which should not be inside any other repositories), use the following command to copy the repository to your local machine:

git clone [THE URL THAT YOU COPIED]

After the process runs, you should have a new directory containing the repository in your present working directory.

# Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the general public has access to the source code of a program. This means that other programmers can modify and grow the source code of a program to enhance, modify, or otherwise change it. These new programs can be shared under the same open source license to promote further growth.

# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I feel that open source code is a good idea - it allows programmers from different backgrounds to collaborate on projects greater than any one person could accomplish. There are positives and negatives to sharing the source code of a project, however. If my financial future depending on my code, I would be nervous about sharing my work over an open source license. However, I also believe that quality work is its own reward, and sharing my code with countless programmers allows other people with different perspectives to improve upon my work, and opens up opportunities that would otherwise not exist, such as future collaborations with other developers.

# Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are very important to include. It lets other programmers and developers know exactly what can or cannot be done with your source code. This can prevent someone from taking your work, changing the license to something more restrictive, and profiting off of your work. It protects the integrity of the project by making sure that other contributions are made in good faith under the same license.

# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Extra practice with the git commands is always appreciated! I struggled with remembering a few of the commands and syntax, but I was able to review the previous reflections and lessons to re-familiarize myself with them. I also felt like I achieved a better understanding of how the branches relate to the master repository, and how the local copy relates to the remote repository.

# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Just the previous bootcamp lessons and reflections.

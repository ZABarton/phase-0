# Think About Time

Most of these ideas were fairly new to me, so I began at the top of my list and worked my way down. I spent the most time learning about meditation and the Pomodoro Technique. Meditation, while not something I've done in the past, seems like a great way to build focus in the morning which will help last throughout the day. The Pomodoro Technique seems like a very solid way to build a structure for the work days during phase 0, in terms of setting schedules, estimating completion times, and measuring progress.

Time boxing is simply setting aside a consistent block of time to work on a task, and then measuring the progress and accomplishments at the end of each block - the Pomodoro Technique is the perfect example of this. This will be very helpful in Phase 0, since most of the coding concepts are new and unfamiliar. By setting aside specific lengths of time to work on tasks, I can measure improvements by how many increments it takes to complete them. It also allows me to maintain focus as the tasks grow more difficult. Rather than get distracted when a problem gets too difficult, I'm motivated to use the time block as best I can to solve the problem and continue working.

I currently manage my time by setting aside large blocks of time for general activities. This means that I wake up at a certain time, use the first few hours of the day for the gym, a healthy breakfast, and preparing for the day, then follow through with a large time block set aside for work. For now, this is a viable strategy. However, while this is a good framework to organize the day, there is certainly room for improvement. Subdividing these large blocks into smaller time increments will allow me to focus on specific tasks during the work phase. For instance, I should expect a trip to the gym to take no more than two or three Pomodoro segments, depending on the workout. Subdividing the time this way will keep me focused on getting finished on time and ready to start the work day as planned - eliminating most of the chatter and distractions at the gym, but still allowing for small breaks in between increments.

My plan for Phase 0 is to implement the Pomodoro Technique into the general framework I've already planned out. By breaking down the framework into individual Pomodoro blocks, I can keep myself on track, maintain focus by allowing myself small breaks in between increments, and measure progress day after day. This allows me to get the most out of a working day without suffering from burning out too early. As I get more comfortable with this way of thinking, it allows me to add additional Pomodoro blocks into the schedule as I see fit - for instance, adding an increment for meditation at the beginning of the day to help with overall focus.

# The Command Line

A shell is basically a processor that can execute commands given directly to to computer, rather than through a graphical interface. Bash is a specific type of shell for the UNIX operating system. As I am currently working on these assignments on a Windows system, I used a different shell (Powershell).

The most challenging part of this lesson was getting through the video, to be honest. It was hard to follow along with the video for an hour without having any practical examples to work on alongside of watching it. Since a lot of these concepts were new, a lot of things in the video did not make sense until getting the chance to go through the Command Line Crash Course. That course definitely improved my understanding of shell commands by actually working through examples. All of the commands I learned through the crash course successfully worked as intended.

To me, it seems like the most important shell commands are searching through files for very specific pieces of information. This is something that would be very time-consuming through the standard graphical interfaces that I am used to, and can be done much more efficiently through the shell. This requires more memorization of commands so that I could confidently navigate through the shell, but the payoff in time and efficiency seems well worth it.

The commands listed perform the following functions:

pwd - Print working directory: shows your current location in the directory tree

ls - Lists the files and directories in a specific directory

mv - Moves (or renames) files

cd - Changes your location in the directory tree

../ - Changes your location to the next higher directory in the tree

touch - Creates a new file (on the UNIX operating system)

mkdir - Creates a new directory

less - displays the contents of a file in a separate screen

rmdir - Deletes a directory (and on Windows, allows you to also delete the contents within)

rm - Deletes a file

help - Displays the built-in help manual for specific commands, including help itself

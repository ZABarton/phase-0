- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

This exercise went fairly well! I do have a little bit of experience working with HTML so it was a good refresher course. Working with a pair definitely helped speed things up by fairly dividing the tasks. For instance, the driver could enter in the raw text while the navigator researched issues that arose, such as finding the correct character substitutions for the copyright and trademark symbols.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

This went well - both of us had a good grasp on the HTML elements needed to complete this exercise. We had to do some research on table and div layouts. We also took the time to experiment in the editor if we weren't sure about the proper usage of an element - for instance, what would happen if we nested these tags differently? Purposefully breaking the code sometimes provided a good learning experience.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Pretty good! There were a few things we learned about workflow. We chose to start by entering in all of the raw text from the sample website first, and then add the elements later. This would have been easier if the editor did not supply the closing tags automatically when we created the opening tags. It meant we had to shift the text around to fit the newly created tags.

We chose to use a simple unordered list to match the image provided in the exercise text, but then decided to try making a table layout once we visited the original Berkshire Hathaway site. We had to do some research to determine the correct nesting of tags, and learned why tables might not be the best solution. There are a lot of additional code brackets to keep track of! We reverted back to the unordered list. Still, it was good to go through the exercise and learn firsthand about tables.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

There are some limits to what you can do with HTML, which is most likely by design - after all, it is a markup language. However, it is very powerful when used for its intended purpose. It is good that the standards are always evolving - we learned firsthand why tables might not be a good idea - but it means that there is a lot more memorization required to keep your coding practices up to date.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Honestly, at this point it seems like the best trick is just to practice, practice, practice. Most of the commands are intuitive but it just helps to memorize them as best we can. When writing HTML, keeping your files neat and clean by using indentation is a big help in tracking down errors. It also makes the final product more readable and easier to understand.
